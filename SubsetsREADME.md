### Introduction

This is a C++ solution for the "Subsets" problem, which requires generating all possible subsets of a given array of unique elements. The solution uses a backtracking approach to efficiently generate these subsets.

### Problem Statement

Given an integer array `nums` containing unique elements, the task is to generate all possible subsets of `nums`. The solution set must not contain duplicate subsets, and the result should be returned in any order.

### Solution

The solution employs a recursive backtracking algorithm to generate the subsets. The key idea is to explore all possible subsets by considering whether to include or exclude each element in the array. The process is as follows:

1. Start with an empty `subset` vector and an empty `result` vector to store the subsets.

2. Push the empty `subset` into the `result` vector initially since an empty subset is always a valid subset.

3. Recursively explore all possible subsets starting from index 0 of the `nums` array. At each step, consider including the current element (if not already in the `subset`) and recursively explore further subsets, and then backtrack by excluding the current element.

4. Repeat step 3 for each index in the `nums` array.

5. The `result` vector will contain all the valid subsets.

### Code Explanation

The code consists of a `Solution` class with two functions:

- `subsets`: This is the main function that takes the `nums` vector as input and returns a vector of vectors containing all possible subsets.

- `generateSubsets`: This is a helper function used for recursive backtracking. It takes the `nums` vector, the current `index`, the `subset` being constructed, and the `result` vector as arguments.

### Usage

To use this code to generate subsets for your own input array, follow these steps:

1. Include the necessary header files at the beginning of your C++ file:

```cpp
#include <vector>
```

2. Copy and paste the `Solution` class and the `subsets` function into your C++ file.

3. Create a `std::vector<int>` containing your input numbers, e.g., `std::vector<int> nums = {1, 2, 3};`.

4. Create an instance of the `Solution` class, and call the `subsets` function with your `nums` vector as an argument.

5. The `subsets` function will return a vector of vectors containing all possible subsets.

6. You can then process and utilize the generated subsets as needed for your specific application.

### Example

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <vector>

// ... (Copy and paste the Solution class and subsets function here)

int main() {
    std::vector<int> nums = {1, 2, 3};
    Solution solution;
    std::vector<std::vector<int>> subsets = solution.subsets(nums);
    
    // Print the subsets
    for (const auto& subset : subsets) {
        std::cout << "[";
        for (const auto& num : subset) {
            std::cout << num << " ";
        }
        std::cout << "]" << std::endl;
    }
    
    return 0;
}
